To set up `python-chromex` for local development:

1. Fork [python-chromex](<https://github.com/danphenderson/python-chromex>) (look for the "Fork" button).
2. Clone your fork locally:
   `git clone git@github.com:YOURGITHUBNAME/python-chromex.git`

3. Create a branch for local development:

    `git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature`

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
